I användargränsnittsdesign (UI design) finns det ett koncept som kallas kort, ibland kallad kortcentrerad design (card centered design, card-based design, eller bara card design).

> A card is a container for a few short, related pieces of information. It roughly resembles a playing card in size and shape, and is intended as a linked, short representation of a conceptual unit.
